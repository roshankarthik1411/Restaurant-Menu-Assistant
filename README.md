## 🎯 Problem Statement
In many restaurants, customers struggle to:
- Understand menu items and ingredients  
- Identify vegetarian, vegan, or allergen-safe options  
- Get quick answers about pricing and availability  

This often leads to delays, confusion, and increased workload for restaurant staff.

## 💡 Solution
The Restaurant Menu Assistant allows users to ask natural language questions such as:
- “What are the vegetarian dishes available?”
- “Does this dish contain nuts?”
- “What is the price of the pasta?”
- “What do you recommend for a spicy meal?”

The assistant processes the query, identifies user intent, and provides clear, accurate responses based on menu data and prompt-driven logic.
